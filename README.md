 # Students managment system 

 The student management system is an environment where all the process of the student in the institution is managed.
 This is a simple app that an admin can add students details. and have one log in page whom that has accsess on username and 
 password can use this app. why I made just log on page because of securitiy and all can get accsess on students details.
 I made this app for an specifice course , center , universaity and other learning place .

 ## _**Design**_

  * ### _Font:_
    * I used a Google Font called Lato with regular (400) weight and add Italic style to all of the headers and normal for rest of the page.
 
  * ### _Colors:_
   * I uesed white and black colors for this app
   * But for bottom I used specifice colors like:
      * Blue for submit , add student and edit bottom.
      * Red for delete and close bottom.

## _**Technology Used**_
* [Django reast frame work](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/ "Django reast framework Project website")
    - Django was used to build the models, forms and views of the app, and was the backbone of this project.
* [React js](https://react.dev/learn "React.js Project website")
    - React was used to build the frintend of this project.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/ "Bootstrap")
     - Bootstrap was used to implement the responsiveness of the site, using bootstrap classes, but also other styling such as buttons etc.
* [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/ "Cloudinary")
     - Cloudinary was used as free cloud storage for images uploaded to the site through the recipe forms.
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts")
    - Google fonts were used to import the fonts "Playfair Display" and "Lato" into the style.css file. These fonts were used throughout the project.
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/ "FontAwesome")
     - Font Awesome was used on all pages throughout the website to import icons (e.g. social media icons) for UX purposes.
* [GitPod](https://git-scm.com/ "GitPod")
     - Git was used for version control by utilizing the GitPod terminal to commit to Git and push to GitHub.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/ "Link to GitHub")
     - GitHub was used to store the project after pushing
* [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/ "ElephantSQL Database")
    - ElephantSQL was used to the new database instead of the Heroku's Postgres

# Deployment
## Set up ElephantSQL as Database for this application ##

  - Go to the ElephantSQL website (https://www.elephantsql.com/) and create an account.

  - After creating an account, you will be able to create a new PostgreSQL database. Choose the plan that best fits your needs and click "Create new instance".

  - Give your database a name and select a region.

  - Once the database is created, you will see the database details page. Here, you can find the connection details for your database, including the hostname, port, database name, and username.

  - To connect to the database using the connection details provided.
## Set Up Cloudinary to host images and template files ##

  - Sign up for a Cloudinary account at https://cloudinary.com/users/register/free.

  - In the dashboard, you will see your "Cloud Name", "API Key", and "API Secret". These are saved as environment valiables in ***Heruko*** and .env local file.

  - Install the Cloudinary Python library by running the following command:

        pip install cloudinary

  - Add cloudinary in INSTALLED_APPS list in settings.py
  - Add the following code to your Django settings file to configure the Cloudinary library with your account credentials:

    ```
      STATIC_URL = '/static/'
      STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.StaticHashedCloudinaryStorage'
      STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static'),]
      STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')

      CLOUDINARY_STORAGE = {
          'CLOUD_NAME': os.environ.get('CLOUD_NAME'),
          'API_KEY': os.environ.get('API_KEY'),
          'API_SECRET': os.environ.get('API_SECRET'),
      }
      
      MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
      DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'
    ```
  - Run the following command to apply the changes to your Django project:
    ```
        python manage.py migrate
    ```

## Deployment to Heroku ##
  - On Heroku create an account and log in.
  - Goto ci-students team
  - Click ***new*** and ***create new app***.

- [Gp Multipurpose HTML and Bootstrap Template](https://bootstrapmade.com/gp-free-multipurpose-html-bootstrap-template/)
- [Stackoverflow website](https://stackoverflow.com/)

### Automated:

- used the msw library to mock user and logout endpoints
- tested the NavBar component:
  - renders without a problem
  - renders the link to a user profile for a logged in user
  - renders the sign in and sign up buttons again on logout

### Manual:

- every other feature tested extensively

## Libraries, contexts and hooks:

- react-infinite-scroll-component
  - introduced to replace traditional pagination with lazy loading instead of pagination to make the application more performant and seem more snappy/ engaging
- react-bootstrap:
  - introduced
- contexts:
  - CurrentUserContext exposes the user state to the entire app. Relevant components can subscribe to its changes
  - ProfileDataContext exposes the profile state to the entire app. Enables the PopularProfiles component to be in sync with the ProfilePage contents
- custom hooks written to reduce repeatable state logic:
  - useClickOutsideToggle: enable toggle on the burger menu
  - useRedirect: enable redirect for users who are either logged in or logged out, depending on the use case

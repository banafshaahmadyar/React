 # Students managment system 

 The student management system is an environment where all the process of the student in the institution is managed.
 This is a simple app that an admin can add students details. and have one log in page whom that has accsess on username and 
 password can use this app. why I made just log on page because of securitiy and all can get accsess on students details.
 I made this app for an specifice course , center , universaity and other learning place .

## Deployment steps

- add prebuild script
- add Procfile
- remove all console.logs
- use Bootstrap default imports to minimize the build
- deploy to Heroku

## Tests:

### Automated:

- used the msw library to mock user and logout endpoints
- tested the NavBar component:
  - renders without a problem
  - renders the link to a user profile for a logged in user
  - renders the sign in and sign up buttons again on logout

### Manual:

- every other feature tested extensively

## Libraries, contexts and hooks:

- react-infinite-scroll-component
  - introduced to replace traditional pagination with lazy loading instead of pagination to make the application more performant and seem more snappy/ engaging
- react-bootstrap:
  - introduced
- contexts:
  - CurrentUserContext exposes the user state to the entire app. Relevant components can subscribe to its changes
  - ProfileDataContext exposes the profile state to the entire app. Enables the PopularProfiles component to be in sync with the ProfilePage contents
- custom hooks written to reduce repeatable state logic:
  - useClickOutsideToggle: enable toggle on the burger menu
  - useRedirect: enable redirect for users who are either logged in or logged out, depending on the use case
